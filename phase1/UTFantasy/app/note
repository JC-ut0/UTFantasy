# Step 1
Added note to the project.
Construct a basic frame of the project.
Now we have MainThread.
Activities: MainActivity, StartupActivity(done), LoginActivity(halfWay), CustomizeActivity(halfWay), FightActivity, ShopActivity, MenuActivity.
Managers: UserManager (more later, FightManager, MenuManager)
Completed Files: None

########
# Step 2
Add and implement MapView.java, MainThread.java, UnitDraw.java. Implement MainActivity.

########
# Step 3
Add lawn.png

########
# Step 4
Updated LoginActivity, now some exceptions will be caught.
Updated FightActivity(halfWay)

########
# Step 5
Implement walk functionality.
Rewrite main_activity content form. Now formed as (FrameLayout(RelativeLayout(palette),mapView))

########
# Step 6
add basic interaction of fight activity

########
# Step 7
User can log in and register, all data will be stored to local (data.text)
Issue: if User chooses to log in, he will get a new 'ET' player because the data of player is not stored locally.

########
# Step 8
Correct fight action under fight activity, now this action can do basic function correctly

########
# Step 9
Now we have a unique UserManager!!!!!!
All data are stored locally! Pleas get User and Player from the unique UserManager!!!!
Do not use getSerializableExtra any more, unless there is no other solution.
Call UserManager's save(Context) method if you want to save the data locally!

#######
# Step 10
Changed Skill class to interface.

########
# Step 11
Draw the player in the middle of the screen, player appearance will change corresponding to the his or her moving direction
Make the player not able to cross the trees. change the map to a proper size. Add some trees to the map

########
# Step 12
Reformat MainActivity content, now the most basic frame layout is written in XML and MapView is added into a linear layout inside the frame layout
Add a menu button so that user can click on the menu button to check his or her bag or close the menu
Add button A and B to the MainActivity

########
# Step 13
Finish ShopActivity.
You can buy potions now!

########
# Step 14
Create the Menu System. Now we have a Bag menu(pokemons and potions),
Player information(gender, money and characters'name) and the System Menu(save and logout).
You can see your little pokenmons and your information Now!

########
# Step 15
Change bag to HashMap.
You can see your little pokemons and your information Now!

#########
# Step 16

Now the fight activity and fight manager can do a complete loop of fighting system

#########
# Step 17
improve fight activity and fight manager. Now the image and health bar of pokemons can be updated correctly

#########
# Step 18
Rewrite the UnitDraw, MapManager and MapView so that use a single one bitmap to draw the same image
Greatly improve the app speed
Add onResume, onPause, onDestroy to make mainActivity a more complete lifecycle


########
# Step 19
- Changes to all NPC: all NPC now have two method trade and ability.
The ability is set to be nothing by default. only fighterNPC and healerNPC have ability right now.
all npc can "trade", but only salerNPC have the real trade method.
- Change to NPCManager: NPCManager do not have static method anymore.
    every player has his own NPCManager to track the npc status.
    get a npc by finding the player first and then get the npc.
