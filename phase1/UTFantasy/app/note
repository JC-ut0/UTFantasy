# Step 1
Added note to the project.
Construct a basic frame of the project.
Now we have MainThread.
Activities: MainActivity, StartupActivity(done), LoginActivity(halfWay), CustomizeActivity(halfWay), FightActivity, ShopActivity, MenuActivity.
Managers: UserManager (more later, FightManager, MenuManager)
Completed Files: None

########
# Step 2
Add and implement MapView.java, MainThread.java, UnitDraw.java. Implement MainActivity.

########
# Step 3
Add lawn.png

########
# Step 4
Updated LoginActivity, now some exceptions will be caught.
Updated FightActivity(halfWay)

########
# Step 5
Implement walk functionality.
Rewrite main_activity content form. Now formed as (FrameLayout(RelativeLayout(palette),mapView))

########
# Step 6
add basic interaction of fight activity

########
# Step 7
User can log in and register, all data will be stored to local (data.text)
Issue: if User chooses to log in, he will get a new 'ET' player because the data of player is not stored locally.

########
# Step 8
Correct fight action under fight activity, now this action can do basic function correctly

########
# Step 9
Now we have a unique UserManager!!!!!!
All data are stored locally! Pleas get User and Player from the unique UserManager!!!!
Do not use getSerializableExtra any more, unless there is no other solution.
Call UserManager's save(Context) method if you want to save the data locally!

# Step 10
Changed Skill class to interface.
