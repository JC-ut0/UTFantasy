# Step 1
- Copy all files to phase2 directory, and renamed some file from .phase1. to .phase2.
- Created phase2_note.txt and phase2_TODO.txt for later notes.

#########
# Step 2
Files affected: LoginActivity.java, activity_login.xml
New feature: Remember password, and full screen activity.
            - now if the user selects remember password, his password and username will be stored
            for his next login.

#########
# Step 3
Code affected: MapManager.mapInitialization()
Flaw: Some of "treeImage" are missing in the highMap.
Fix: Add missing "treeImage" to the highMap.

#########
# Step 4
File affected: Person.java, Player.java
Rename pokemon to pokemonList, since this variable refers to an ArrayList.

#########
# Step 5
File added: README
File affected: all files
Created README file, Reformat for all files.

#########
# Step 6
Package affected: Map
Flaw: MapManager violates SOLID, refactor the whole map system according to MVP and SOLID. Use
design patterns as much as possible. Please see the details of whole structure in uml.

########
# Step 7
Flaw: ArrayList is too specific to construct.
Fix: Change ArrayList to List.

########
# Step 8
File affected: MenuActivity.java, PlayerInfoActivity.java
Flaw: These activities violate SOLID
Fix: create a InfoMediator.java, pass the information to the activity. And create ItemAdapter to
control the action from the activity.

########
# Step 9
File affected: PokeSelectActivity.java
Create a new activity and the following java class. Now we can select pokemons at the beginning of
a fight.

########
# Step 10
Refactor for User, UserData, and LoginActivity
Since lots of activities interact with UserData, most files are affected.
File affected: Most activities
- Created UserIO for data access
- Refactored for LoginActivity by MVP
- Refactored UserManager by Single responsibility principle
- Created UML folder for a series of UML diagrams.
- More on LoginActivity UML, please have a look at the LoginActivity_UML.pdf

########
# Step 11
File affected: StartUpActivity, LoginActivity
- Rewrite StartUpActivity allowing user to choose start game or go to the scoreboard.
